This project is basically a reflection of a leetcode problem submission 
profile.

Steps taken to start on this journey.
1. problems and test folders.
2. create a venv
3. install pytest. - what i will be using for testing an running all the test 
cases. some will be self made, others will be copied from leetcode, especially 
    if a 1st solution doen't work. 
 
 
Venv Setup:
1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source ./venv/bin/activate

Install pytest:
1. pip install pytest

# Important notes (Learning)
1. Always re-read the problem. Things are almost always easier than they seem. 
Even if you think you understand the problem, reread it, and write down what 
you have to do to solve the problem.
2. Examples. Create your own, try and think of possible scenarios to test, 
and do that. Always use examples and edge cases to construct your solutions. 
Don't fixate on edge cases, but use them!!.
